## About this project
This project is a chip8 emulator, fully written in python.
I made this because I'm very interested in emulation, and I think this project is a good starting point.

Note that sound is not implemented yet.

## Use
To run the code, do `python3 main.py <filename>`, where `filename` is the path to a chip8 binary program.
